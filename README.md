# pascalos
Modefied Slax distro for mining PascalCoin

Look at https://github.com/T00ManySecrets/pascalos/releases/ for the img files

Instalation:
Use win32 Disk imager to write the image to a usb.
OLDGENCPU.img uses RHminer OLD_GEN version for linux
NEWGENCPU.img uses RHminer NEW_GEN version for linux

Usage:
Boot from usb and the the system will autologin and start mining(you do have to have a wired ethernet connection).

CTRL+C to stop mining
nano mining.sh to edit the pool and account for mining.
bash mining.sh to start mining again

I take no credit for RHminer and Slax linux used in this.
Source code for both can be found on github.

Donations are welcome in PascalCoin
